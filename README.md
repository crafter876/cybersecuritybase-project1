A2 - Broken Authentication and Session Management

No verification before resetting password. 
Application's password reset doesn't actually do anything, but in real situation attackers could get access to users account by resetting password.
Problem can be identified by just visiting the page.

Issue: Broken Authentication and Session Management
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run java project
2. Go to localhost:8080
3. Sign in with username "ted" and password "ted" and click Login button
4. In the "form" page click reset password
5. Enter new password and confirmation (original password not necessary)
6. Click submit

Fix: Original password has to be queried from the user and used for user verification before password reset.

A3 - Cross-Site Scripting

Attacker can upload malicious javascript code through text fields.
Owasp ZAP can be used to fuzz name and address fields, but tester would still need to manually find all pages that print stored scripts.

Issue: Cross-Site Scripting
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run java project
2. Go to localhost:8080
3. Sign in with username "ted" and password "ted" and click Login button
4. In the "form" page type in "ted" as name and "<script>alert('BOO!')</script>" as address and press submit
5. "user has been signed up to the event" appears. This stores the script as executable that will run when sent to the victim's browser
6. Go back to localhost:8080
7. If you are still logged in, type in "ted" as name and anything you want as an address
8. This sends you to duplicate page and browser runs the javascript that was previously stored

Fix: Validate all inputs so they can't take characters "<" and ">"
__________

A4 - Insecure Direct Object References

Attacker can write "/duplicate?name=XXX" into address bar and try to find out if the name was registered and what address that user has.
Owasp ZAP identifies name=value as sensitive object.

Issue: Insecure Direct Object References
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run java project
2. Go to localhost:8080
3. Sign in with username "ted" and password "ted" and click Login button
4. In the "form" page type in "ted" as name and "address" as address and press submit
5. You will receive a message indicating that user has signed up to the event
6. Go to localhost:8080/duplicate?name=ted
7. Message will show that ted has already registered and his address

Fix: No simple fix. Only viable solution is to stop using names as parameters for URL.
__________

A6 - Sensitive Data Exposure 

Re-entering person's name for event registration will show if that person has already registered and show his/her address.
Resending form with POST -parameters in ZAP produces duplicate -message no matter which user created original registration.

Issue: Sensitive Data Exposure
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run java project
2. Go to localhost:8080
3. Sign in with username "ted" and password "ted" and click Login button
4. In the "form" page type in "ted" as name and "address" as address and press submit
5. You will receive a message indicating that user has signed up to the event
6. go back to localhost:8080/form
7. insert "ted" as name and click submit
8. message displayed will show ted's address

Fix: add "httpSession.invalidate();" into beginning of defaultMapping() and loadForm() in SignupController.
__________

A8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery 

Application doesn't prevent CSRF attacks so it's possible to create malicious website for directing browser requests while authenticated.
Problem can be identified by creating a malicious web page using POST -parameters for resetPassword (from ZAP).

Issue: Cross-Site Request Forgery
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run java project
2. Go to localhost:8080
3. Sign in with username "ted" and password "ted" and click Login button
4. In the "form" page type in "ted" as name and "address" as address and press submit
5. Create a web page called password_change.html
6. Write the following inside html -file
	<form action="http://localhost:8080/resetPassword" method="POST">
	<input type="password" name="password" value="changed"/>
	<input type="password" name="confirm" value="changed"/>
	</form>
	<body onload="document.forms[0].submit()">
7. Write location of html file into browser's url bar and hit enter
8. Web page will post the data needed for changing password to "changed" without user confirmation

Fix: Remove http.csrf().disable() from SecurityConfiguration.java.c
__________

**EXTRA**


A5 - Security Misconfiguration

SecurityConfiguration has http.headers disabled. This results in OWASP Zap showing lot of header errors.
This can be fixed by removing http.headers().disable() (line 25) from code.
__________

A9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

Application uses old version of spring framework (1.4.2) which can be seen from pom.xml.
This can be fixed by changing 1.4.2.RELEASE to 1.5.9.RELEASE on line 16 of pom.xml file.
